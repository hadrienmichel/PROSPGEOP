# PROSPGEOP
This repository contains all the codes for the practicals of the class "Prospection Géophysique" from Pr. NGUYEN (ULiège). (The diffrent codes are availble in Jupyter Notebook form, there is thus no need to download anything since everything can run inside the web browser through the Binder app.)

During those practicals, you will see different geophysical methods, how to interpret them individually and integrate this interpretation inside a global geophysical model. The different geophysical methods are:
- MAG (Magnetic)
- EMI (ElectroMagnetic Induction)
- ERT (Electrical Resistivity Tomography)
- IP (Induced Polarisation)
- Seismic Refraction

For those practicals, we will see several case studies. Nonetheless, one site will follow us during this whole semester: Colonster. On this site, you will see how the different datasets can completre one-another.

Electromagnetic induction can be gather using different type of instruments:
- Land survey
- Land sounding
- Airbourn survey

## ERT


## IP

## Seismic

# Project
At the end of the semester, you will be asked to go on the field with one of the methods seen in class and availble in our laboratory. The available equipment is:
- EMI (CMD Mini-Explorer from GF Instruments)
- ERT/IP (ABEM LS from ABEM)
- Seismic (??? from ???)

You will work in groupds of 4 on the "Project" area of *Fig.1*. There will be 2 teams working with EMI, 4 teams with ERT/IP and 3 teams with seismics.

You will be asked to interpret your dataset and show your prossess and conclusions in a short (10 minutes) group presentation. After every presentation, you will benefit from a feedback from the teaching team and you will need to write a short report on your investigation (10 pages maximum) taking into account our remarks.

At the last class, we will take all your interpretations together and build a coherent geophysical model for the site.
