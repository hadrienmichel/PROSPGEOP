# PROSPGEOP
This repository contains all the codes for the practicals of the class "Prospection Géophysique" from Pr. NGUYEN (ULiège). (The diffrent codes are availble in Jupyter Notebook form, there is thus no need to download anything since everything can run inside the web browser through the Binder app.)

During those practicals, you will see different geophysical methods, how to interpret them individually and integrate this interpretation inside a global geophysical model. The different geophysical methods are:
- MAG (Magnetic)
- EMI (ElectroMagnetic Induction)
- ERT (Electrical Resistivity Tomography)
- IP (Induced Polarisation)
- Seismic Refraction

Electromagnetic induction can be gather using different type of instruments:
- Land survey
- Land sounding
- Airbourn survey
